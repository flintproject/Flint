* Flint 1.5 (2016-06-XX)

** New features
   - SUNDIALS's ARK solver is available as ARK method; note that, for now,
     this is for pure ODE models only.
   - Support for the modulo operation as csymbol function "Mod" in PHML.
   - It is now possible to send a CSV or ISD file to another gadget through
     the Garuda protocol.
** Improvements
   - Simulation got faster; simulation time reduced by about 30%.
   - Now it can detect non-state physical-quantities defined by ODEs in PHML
     as a model error.
   - The error dialog on simulation failure becomes resizable.
   - <description> can appear in PHML's <arc>.
   - PHML's <transition type="probability"> allows any MathML expression as
     its value.
   - For security reason, user's Flint K3 account is no longer saved.
   - It works with Garuda platform 1.2.
   - Some error messages become more informative.
** Bug fixes
   - Missing edges in a PHML model can be detected more reliably.
   - flint-exec's processes no longer remain running after Flint's exit.
   - An error dialog appears as soon as the loading process exits abnormally.
