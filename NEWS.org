** Supported platforms
   - Windows: Windows 7, 8, and 10.

     OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) is no longer supported.
   - POSIX-like environments, including modern Linux.
** New features
   - Added a program called flint-lodbg, which dumps data layout used during
     simulation for debugging purpose, reading from a layout file.
   - flint2 now experimentally supports CellML and SBML models, as well as
     more menus.

* Flint 1.8 (2017-06-09)

** Supported platforms

   - OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) support is now deprecated; it will be dropped
     with incoming v1.9 release.
   - Java 7 support is also deprecated.
** New features
   - Added a program called flint2 as an experimental feature, a prototype
     of next-generation simulator, currently only supporting PHML models.
     Please note that it is unstable and still under heavy development.
** Improvements
   - Loading a model got faster with more efficient parser.
   - Allow floating-point number literals to end with "."; for example,
     "-2." is now a valid representation of a negative two.
   - isdplot's command options --isdstrip and --isd2csv have been dropped;
     user no longer has to specify either. In addition, --gnuplot option
     is optional now; gnuplot in PATH is chosen by default.

     and --ignore-units (-U).

* Flint 1.7.1 (2016-12-28)

     general setting.

** New features
   - The menu added to export a C source file for simulation from a model.
     Currently the feature supports only pure ODE models.
** Bug fixes

   - Shortcut keys Escape and Ctrl+W (or Cmd+W on Mac) can close subwindows.
** Improvements
   - Calculation time for time evolution has been reduced by about 30% agaist
     the previous version.
   - Output variables no longer includes redundant ones, such as any PHML
     variable-parameters assigned to an input port which has a unique edge
     of reduction "sum".
   - Parameters in a PHML model are limited to static-parameters and initial
     values defined by a formula that does not depends on other parameters.
** Bug fixes
   - Flint now accepts a simulation request from localhost only.

* Flint 1.5 (2016-06-29)

** New features
   - SUNDIALS's ARK solver is available as ARK method; note that, for now,
     this is for pure ODE models only.

   - It is now possible to send a CSV or ISD file to another gadget through
     the Garuda protocol.

   - Now it can detect non-state physical-quantities defined by ODEs in PHML
     as a model error.
   - The error dialog on simulation failure becomes resizable.
   - <description> can appear in PHML's <arc>.
   - PHML's <transition type="probability"> allows any MathML expression as
     its value.
   - For security reason, user's Flint K3 account is no longer saved.
   - It works with Garuda platform 1.2.

** Bug fixes
   - Missing edges in a PHML model can be detected more reliably.
   - flint-exec's processes no longer remain running after Flint's exit.
   - An error dialog appears as soon as the loading process exits abnormally.
