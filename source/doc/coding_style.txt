== Important Note

A leading discussion will and should be needed to change this file's content.

== General

We employ
http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
as a guide. This does neither mean that our code base follows all of items
in the document, nor that it will do. Rather, it means that we can refer
the document as a rationale.

== Consideration for portability

* Do not use "interface" for variable name because it is a keyword in C++/CLI.
  Same as "abstract".

== File extensions for C/C++

Use ".h" for a new C/C++ header file, ".cc" for other C++ source files,
and ".c" for C ones.

== The mode line for moderate editors

In case of adding a new C++ source file, you should start its
content with the following mode line for Emacs and Vim:
/* -*- Mode: C++; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: t; c-basic-offset: 4 -*- vim:set ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 noet: */
It means that we use a tab looking like 4 spaces for indentation.
Likewise, let's prepend
/* -*- Mode: C; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: t; c-basic-offset: 4 -*- vim:set ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 noet: */
to a new C source file.
