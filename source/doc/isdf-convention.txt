This document explains the convention for better interoperability between
software applications exchanging files in the ISDF format.


= On title of variables

Each title of variables in an ISDF file should be unique among them.

== Augmented BNF for variable's title

The following ABNF in the flavor of [RFC5234] defines the syntax for a
variable's title formally:

  title = labeled / unlabeled

  labeled = unlabeled "@" label

  label = 1*VCHAR

  unlabeled = prefixed / name

  prefixed = UUID ":" name

  name = ALPHA *("_" / ALPHA / DIGIT)

where

  UUID is as defined in [RFC4122].


= On Timeseries data

If an ISDF file contains the variable representing the time, then name it
"time" and make it the first variable in the data.
