abstract = {CellML is an XML-based exchange format developed by the University of Auckland in collaboration with Physiome Sciences, Inc. CellML 1.1 has a component-based architecture allowing a modeller to build complex systems of models that expand and reuse previously published models. CellML Metadata is a format for encoding contextual information for a model. CellML 1.1 can be used in conjunction with CellML Metadata to provide a complete description of the structure and underlying mathematics of biological models. A repository of over 200 electrophysiological, mechanical, signal transduction, and metabolic pathway models is available at www.cellml.org.}
