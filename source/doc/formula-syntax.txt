The following ABNF in the flavor of [RFC5234] defines the syntax for a
formula formally:

  formula = product / [formula] op1 product

  op1 = "+" / "-"

  product = factor / product op2 factor

  op2 = "%" / "*" / "/"

  factor = number / identifier / group / call

  group = "(" formula ")"

  call = identifier "(" arguments ")"

  arguments = formula *("," formula)

  identifier = ("_" / ALPHA) *("_" / ALPHA / DIGIT)

where

  number is the same one defined in [RFC7159].

Note that a number of whitespaces can appear between tokens but not in
an identifier.
