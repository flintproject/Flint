This directory contains packaging script for macOS version of Flint.
The script requires Xcode as well as autoconf, automake, cmake,
libtool, and pkg-config.

As a prerequisite, the dependent libraries have to be installed in a
directory before packaging.
Put config.mk in this directory in order to specify PKG_CONFIG Make
variable See config.mk.example for example.
Then running `make` will produce flint-*.dmg for all supported version
of macOS in case of success.
