This directory contains packaging script for Windows installer of Flint.
So far it depends on cross compilation on a POSIX environment.
The packaging process consists of a couple of steps; building binaries
and creating .msi installer package.

= How to build binaries

This step requires the following tools:
* Apache Ant
  http://ant.apache.org/
  in order to create flint.jar
* MinGW-w64
  http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/
  in order to cross-compile Flint components on a POSIX build for Windows host.

Put config.mk in this directory to specify the HOST Make variables.
See config.mk.example for example.
Then running `make` will produce flint.zip in case of success, which contains
all you need at the next step.

= How to create .msi installer package

This step requires the following tools:
* Cygwin
  http://www.cygwin.com/
  in order to run the packaging script in a shell
* Launch4j
  http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/
  in order to create single .exe file from flint.jar
* WiX 3.x
  http://wix.sourceforge.net/
  in order to create .msi installer package
The packaging script assumes that both are in PATH.

Unzip flint.zip and cd flint/.
Then running `make` will produce flint.msi in case of success.
