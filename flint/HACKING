See INSTALL to build and install flint.jar.

== Runtime environment

We assume Java SE 7 (JRE 7) or higher for running Flint.

== Coding Style

We see "Code Style Guidelines for Contributors" of Android Open Source project:
http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html
as a reasonable supplement of the good old "Code Conventions for the Java
Programming Language":
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html

Every Java source file in our project should start with the following mode-line:
/* -*- Mode: Java; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4 -*- vim:set ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 et: */

Please send error or debug messages to a Log4j's logger, instead of printing
them to stdout/stderr without any proper reason.

Do not use java.lang.Throwable#printStackTrace() without any proper reason;
handle or log every exception instead.
