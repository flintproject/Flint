   See config.mk.* for example.

2. Start Cygwin Terminal;
   change directory to this directory;
   and run GNU Make:

3. Launch "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
   (or "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
   if you choose x86 in the above step; see
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts).
