Flint
=====

Flint is a simulator for biological and physiological models written in
[CellML](https://www.cellml.org/), PHML, and/or [SBML](https://www.sbml.org/).
Originally developed as part of an in silico platform of
[Physiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiome), now it aims to provide an
open, language-agnostic resource for reproducible simulation studies.
While existing simulation tools, e.g. [COPASI](http://copasi.org/) and
[OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/), are great for simulation for models in a
specific language, you may find Flint useful if searching a unified solution.

Flint has the following features:

* It can numerically solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations derived
  from models.
* It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
* It provides fully-featured graphical user interface with simplified
  command-line interface.
* It is open source under the MIT license.
