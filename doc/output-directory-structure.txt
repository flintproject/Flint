This document describes the directory structure in which Flint organizes
output.

Given a pair of a PHSP and an SED-ML files by user, Flint runs a batch of
simulations according to all combinations of values assigned to parameters.
First of all Flint generates a unique non-negative integer for each <task>
in the SED-ML, called task-id. Then Flint makes a dedicated directory for
the task, named by the decimal representation of its task-id.
Depending on the PHSP input, a task can consist of a lot of jobs.
In principle a job corresponds to the simulation with a specific combination
of parameter values.
Flint gives every job a non-negative integer, called job-id, unique modulo
the task. Based on the job-ids, Flint also creates a number of fixed-depth
subdirectories in the task directory.

Let's say a task with task-id '7' for example. Assume that the task has
3,000 jobs with job-id '1' to '3000'.
Then, in the simulation, Flint makes the following directories eventually:

7/00/00/00/01/
7/00/00/00/02/
...
7/00/00/00/ff/
7/00/00/01/00/
7/00/00/01/01/
...
7/00/00/0b/b7/
7/00/00/0b/b8/

Note that the "bb8" is the hexadecimal notation of 3000.
The above way of the directory hierarchy allows a task to have as many
jobs as with job-id between '0' and '4294967295' (= 2^32-1).


Flint produces the simulation result in the deepest subdirectories i.e.
the ones of form "(job-id)/xx/xx/xx/xx/". Supposed the above example again,
the output files for the job with job-id '2999' of the task are found in
7/00/00/0b/b7/.

A non-exhaustive summary of output files for each job:

* out.isd
  The main output, timeseries data in ISDF.

* values.txt
  The list of parameters with their values specified in the job.

* stats.txt
  Contains a summary of performance measured for the job.


Flint also generates some of files for informational purposes in the task
directory, as follows:

* parameters.txt
  The list of parameter names used for the task.

* progress
  A binary file of length (max job-id)+1; the byte at index (job-id)
  represents the current progress (0 to 100) of the job.

* rss
  Generated only when using the method of least-squares.
  Contains an array of type double; the value at index (job-id) represents
  the residual sum of squares (RSS) when comparing the job's result with
  given data.
